```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = x), binwidth = 0.5, fill = "blue")
```
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = z), binwidth = 0.5)

```

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(z < 1 | z > 10) %>%
  select(price, x, y, z, carat)
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price), binwidth = 50)
```
We can observe interesting dent around 1500. It is also worth noting that there is more diamonds with price 4xxx rather than with price 3xxx, what is kind of counterintuitive.
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price), binwidth = ) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1000, 2000))
```
```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(between(carat, 0.99, 1.0)) %>%
  group_by(carat) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```
```{r}

```
